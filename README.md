# AI_Newbies-Upstage-AI-Hackathon

## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for the AI_Newbies team participating in the Upstage AI Hackathon. Our project focuses on implementing a fine-tuned model that showcases how tourism ambassadors can leverage AI to promote tourism in Jeju. These ambassadors can use the model to communicate in a manner that reflects their unique personalities and insights about local attractions.

## Brief Synopsis
This project includes two main Jupyter notebooks:
1. [AINewbiesTourismGPT solar_predibase.ipynb](https://github.com/JohnnyRobs19/AI_Newbies-Upstage-AI-Hackathon/blob/dev_Jon/AINewbiesTourismGPT%20solar_predibase.ipynb)
2. [Uncle_Roger_AINewbiesTourismGPT_solar_predibase.ipynb](https://github.com/JohnnyRobs19/AI_Newbies-Upstage-AI-Hackathon/blob/dev_Jon/Uncle_Roger_AINewbiesTourismGPT_solar_predibase.ipynb)
3. [August_2024_Updated_Uncle_Roger_AINewbiesTourismGPT_solar_predibase.ipynb](https://github.com/JohnnyRobs19/AI_Newbies-Upstage-AI-Hackathon/blob/dev_Jon/August_2024_Updated_Uncle_Roger_AINewbiesTourismGPT_solar_predibase.ipynb)

These notebooks detail our approach to training LLM adapters using data extracted from the Official Jeju Tourism Guidebook (Updated June 2024). LLM adapters are small, trainable components that adjust a large pre-trained language model to specific tasks or datasets without needing to retrain the entire model. By training these adapters, we can customize the model’s responses to better reflect the characteristics and promotional needs of Jeju’s tourism sector.
